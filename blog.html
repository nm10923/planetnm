                <h1>Why I have neglected this website</h1>
                <p>TLDR I forgot about my website</p>
                <p>Some people have also been wondering about:</p>
                <p><a href=http://suncithehoghog.weebly.com>Sunci</a></p>
                <p>In all honesty Segu is still working on the beta for Sunci 3 so</p>
                <p>be on the look out for that. They bought Cole Corp, their parent</p>
                <p>company, so now they have complete freedom on what to do</p>
                <p><a href=https://glitchfest.bandcamp.com>Glitchfest</a>
                <p>Some people might be wondering where Glitchfest is. Well 1st</p>
                <p>of I dunno where he is, and second off he isn't signed to our</p>
                <p>label anymore, Cole Corp Records. Speaking of Cole Corp, the</p>
                <p>owner shut down the company because he didn't really care for</p>
                <p>it. Back to Glitchfest. I think he's signed to a record label</p>
                <p>called "Assfuck100 Records" but I honestly don't know. I was </p>
                <p>just his manager. He hasn't made music since the label became</p>
                <p>defunct</p>
                <p>The Youngsta Wolves</p>
                <p>Now most people don't really now about these guys. Hell the only</p>
                <p>thing I knew about them was that one of the members got arrested,</p>
                <p>and that they were signed to our defunct label. After the label</p>
                <p>got defucnt, I never heard from the members again. Toner is probably</p>
                <p>in jail, Neco Isag is doing god knows what, AJG left the band months</p>
                <p>ago, and S3CR3T Hub has a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKlZobThQd7RzM-ywu5q7VQ/videos>YouTube Channel</a> and is probably making</p>
                <p>money off of ad revenue scraps. The only thing I remember is</p>
                <p>that I overheard discussion about a project called "Big Jimmy Wilson".</p>
                <p>Either way Glitchfest and The Youngsta Wolves still own their respective</p>
                <p>Bandcamp pages (We gave them full ownership when we went defunct)</p>
                <p>Just a little update on what's going on. Also I made the navbar black :)</p>

                <h1>Updates to the website</h1>
                <p>I've cleaned up this site a little bit, since if felt like I've been neglecting it.</p>
                  <p>1. Removed the Nico OS section and put Nico OS into the <a href=games>games</a> section</p>
                  <p>2. Made a contact page with my BUSINESS email</p> 
                  <p>And thats about it really. I'm currently working on revamping this site to make it look
                  <p>better. See you soon hopefully</p>
