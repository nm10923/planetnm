      <p class=postText>Record collecting is really boring for people who aren't interested in it, but I will make a post about it anyways. I didn't want to post it to twitter because that risks me getting suspended, and I didn't want to post this to reddit because... well I think it's pretty obvious why I don't want to post there. Here are some records I want to get in 2020.</p>
